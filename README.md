- You are going to remember, but that is lost after all.
- In the vast sea of people, we met without any warning or for any reason.
- What are we crave for?After a long time, I learned that we don’t want each other,but ourselves.
- What we see clearly in any love is ourselves.In the winter in the north, the leaves will fall out.
- A poet named Nie Muda said that when the gorgeous leaves are gone, the context of life can be seen.
- At this time,our love will be clear, sensitive, and strong like the branches in the northern winter …-when I miss you！
